Clasker is a task managing mode with automatization in mind. Clasker
uses a special buffe, so text input is disabled by default. Let's say
clasker buffers are less 'open' than org-mode ones, but clasker makes
it easier to implement workflows over tasks.

The basic idea of clasker is that a ticket or task is just a set of
properties that is related to other tasks in a hierarchy.
