* Clasker
  *Clasker requires emacs 24.0 or higher*
** Overview
   Clasker is a task managing mode with automatization in mind. Clasker
   uses a special buffe, so text input is disabled by default. Let's say
   clasker buffers are less 'open' than org-mode ones, but clasker makes
   it easier to implement workflows over tasks.

   The basic idea of clasker is that a ticket or task is just a set of
   properties that is related to other tasks in a hierarchy.

   Create new tickets with clasker-new-tickets (default binded to c), or
   clasker-new-child-tickets (binded to C) to add new tickets as children
   of ticket at point.

   Navigate through the tickets with 'n' and 'p' for next and previous.

   To edit a ticket, pres RET on a ticket, and a menu will appear with
   the possible actions you can apply to that ticket. Default ones are
   archive and edit.

   There are plugins that can be activated to add all kinds of
   functionality on top of this basic functionality.

** Basic usage and bindings
   - 'n' move to next task
   - 'p' move to previous task
   - 'c' create new top-level task
   - 'C' create new task that's descendant of the task at cursor
   - RET opens the actions menu

*** Actions
    Tasks will have different actions depending basically on 2
    elements: The type of the task and the actual state of it.

    After pressing RET on a task, clasker will show the activable
    tasks for it. Some general ones are:
    - *Archive*. Tags the task as archived, and will grey it out. After
      a while from being archieved, a task disappears from the
      listing.
    - *Edit*. Opens a buffer to edit the description of the task. By
      convention, first line is the heading, and is what will be
      printed in the listing.

** Marking tasks
   With 'm' you can mark tickets and unmark them with 'u'. Not really
   useful yet, but just in case you wanna use it for your plugins

** Plugins
   Clasker can be customized with plugins which add new actions for
   tasks, or add new task types. With the core clasker distribution,
   you'll find:

*** Active task
    Mark a task as active, and it will be highlighted in the
    listing. If you enable this plugin, the globally accessible
    clasker-active-ticket will be set to the current active task.

*** Workflows

*** Github
    This plugin requires [[https://github.com/sigma/gh.el][gh.el]] which you can find in elpa.

*** debug

*** Pomodoro
** Colaborate
   This project is in a very early state, and we're mostly rethinking
   it as it evolves. If you like this project and have some ideas to
   contribute, we're more than open to discuss them.

   - Use github's pull requests for code collaborations
   - For suggestions and ideas, you can try #clasker at freenode
     and/or github issues.
